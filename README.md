# Billit

As a freelancer i needed some way to organize my bills. Also i wanted to dive into some nodeJS tools. Here is the result, nothing fancy, just to get it done.

I used [sailsJS](http://sailsjs.org).

Also i applied a free html5 theme from [HTML5 UP](http://html5up.net/)

// work frozen/interrupted because my workload on official stuff went to high...
